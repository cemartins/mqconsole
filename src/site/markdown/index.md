MQConsole is a small JavaFX2 utility application which allows you to interact
with a messaging broker (currently supports WebsphereMQ, ActiveMQ and HornetQ).

From the main window with the list of available queues you can:

- See the list the messages in a queue
- View the details of specific message
- Send a new message to a queue and wait for its response
- Subscribe to a queue or topic and display messages as they arrive.


No need to have administrative credentials, just configure the hostname where the broker is, 
the channel and the name of the queue manager.

Please see the [project page](https://github.com/cemartins/mqconsole) at Github for source code and 
support and the [binary packages page](https://bintray.com/cemartins/mqconsole/MQConsole) for downloads.
